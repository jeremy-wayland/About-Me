- 👋 Hi, I’m Jeremy
- 👀 I’m interested in Computational Topology, Graph Learning, and Data Science. 
- 🌱 I’m currently a PhD Candidate in Mathematics at the Technical University in Munich and a Research Scientist at Helmholtz Munich.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects (python, julia) on climate change and predictive medicine, especially those that leverage geometric and topological techniques. I'm also interested in foundational research in the field of geometric and topological machine learning.

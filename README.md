- 👋 Hi, I’m Jeremy
- 👀 I’m interested in Computational Topology, Graph Learning, and Data Science. 
- 🌱 I’m currently a PhD Candidate in Mathematics at the Technical University in Munich and a Research Scientist at Helmholtz Munich. I'm a new member of the [@aidos-lab](https://github.com/aidos-lab) !
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects (python, julia) in the fields of **climate change** and **computational biology** and **predictive medicine**. I'm especially interested in leverage geometric and topological techniques in these areas to bring novel insights. I'm also interested in foundational research in the field of geometric and topological machine learning.
